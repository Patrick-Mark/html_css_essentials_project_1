        <h2> What is Mindfulness?</h2>
        <p>Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to whatever is happening in the present moment and experiencing it without judgement.

            Anyone can practice mindfulness. It is easy to fit into your day. You can do it one minute at a time.
            Benefits of mindfulness
            
            Mindfulness helps bring you into the present. It helps you focus on what's happening right at this moment. It allows you to develop a new habit that helps to weaken old and unhelpful thinking habits. Becoming aware of the present moment can help you enjoy the world around you more.
