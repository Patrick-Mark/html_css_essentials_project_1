# Testing
The site was tested with the 'inspect' option in Firefox and Chrome, by employing the different device screen sizes.

## Validator Testing

![html validation](/media/html_valid.JPG)  
The code passed html validation with no errors. 

![css validation](/media/css_valid.JPG)  
The css code passed css validation with no errors.  
  
![lighthouse score](/media/lighthouse.JPG)  
The Lighthouse score accessibility score was high, but the performance was low (this is likely due to the size of the image content)




## Bugs
There was a bug when the video was inserted with the video element, this was solved by taking the embed code from YouTube directly.  
Unfixed Bugs: The performance score from Lighthouse was low due to the size of the images.

## Deployment

The Github deployment process consisted of navigating to my Github repo, selecting 'Settings' from the options bar, then navigating to the 'pages' location. From the 'pages' location, selecting the repo branch and selecting 'publish'. This provides a livelink where the site can be accessed and used. 

The site was deployed before submission so that a live link could be used and referenced on other devices and sent to my tutor for review.
